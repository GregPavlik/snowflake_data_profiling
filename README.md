# Snowflake Data Profiling

Profiles data in Snowflake tables and views including statistics, data classification and more.

Note: This software is a community project released under the Apache 2.0 License, not official Snowflake software.

This project profiles data in Snowflake tables to help identify tables and columns interesting for analysis. It is particularly useful for databases with a large number of tables, for example from ERP systems or commercial, off the shelf software with a large number of tables.

The project can also help classify data. Currently this uses column name analysis only, but will be augmented to support classification by data sampling.
